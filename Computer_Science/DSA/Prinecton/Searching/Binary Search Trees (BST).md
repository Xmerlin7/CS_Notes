# Explanation
+ Binary trees is a data structures made up of nodes that contain links.
+ Links in Binary tress are either null or references to other nodes.
+ In a binary tree, every node is pointed to by just one other node, which is called its parent (except for one node, the root, which has no nodes pointing to it).
+ In a binary tree, each node has exactly two links, which are called its left and right links, that point to nodes called its left child and right child, respectively.
+ In a binary tree, each link references to (disjoint) subtrees that are themselves binary trees.
+ A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree where each node has a Comparable key and an associated value.
+ BST satisfies the restriction that the key in any node is larger than the keys in all nodes in that node’s left subtree and smaller than the keys in all nodes in that node’s right subtree.

# Analysis
+ The running times of algorithms on binary search trees depend on the shapes of the trees, which, in turn, depend on the order in which keys are inserted. 
+ In the best case, a tree with N nodes could be perfectly balanced, with ~ $lg N$ nodes between the root and each null link. 
+ In the worst case there could be N nodes on the search path. The balance in typical trees turns out to be much closer to the best case than the worst case.
+ BSTs are dual to [[Quick Sort]]. 
+ The node at the root of the tree corresponds to the first partitioning item in [[Quick Sort]] (no keys to the left are larger, and no keys to the right are smaller).
+ Search hits in a BST built from N random keys require ~ $2 ln N$ (about $1.39 lg N$) compares, on the average.
+ Insertions and search misses in a BST built from N random keys require ~ $2 ln N$ (about $1.39 lg N$) compares, on the average.
+ In a BST, all operations take time proportional to the height of the tree, in the worst case.
+ After sufficiently long sequence of random inserts and deletes (using successor), the height of the tree becomes $\sqrt{N}$.
