# Explanation
+ A graph is a set of vertices and a collection of edges that each connect a pair of vertices.

+ When there is an edge connecting two vertices, we say that the vertices are adjacent to one another and that the edge is incident to both vertices. 
+ The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it.
+ A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices connected by edges. 
+ A simple path is one with no repeated vertices. 
+ A cycle is a path with at least one edge whose first and last vertices are the same. 
+ A simple cycle is a cycle with no repeated edges or vertices (except the requisite repetition of the first and last vertices). 
+ The length of a path or a cycle is its number of edges.
+ A graph is connected if there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex in the graph.

+ An acyclic graph is a graph with no cycles.
+ A tree is an acyclic connected graph.
+ A spanning tree of a connected graph is a subgraph that contains all of that graphâ€™s vertices and is a single tree.

+ A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices we can divide into two sets such that all edges connect a vertex in one set with a vertex in the other set.
